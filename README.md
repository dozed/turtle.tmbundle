turtle.tmbundle
===============

Totally awesome bundle for Turtle â€“ the terse RDF triple language.

For now it contains only a provisionally language grammar that has the following limits:

+ only supports prefix notation for URIrefs
+ supports comments
+ supports complete SPO statements
+ supports shorthand notation for multiple PO-pairs
+ supports URI expressions, literals, typed literals, bnodes
